# NHS England Template Model Card

This is a work in progress repository where a generic [model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993) template is being developed.

Any project involving a machine learning model can use this template and include it in their own repository. This means that whenever a model is updated, the model card can be updated alongside.

The repo includes:

1. The model card template
2. An images folder where visualisations such as a confusion matrix can be stored for use in a model card
