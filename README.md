# model-card

This is a work in progress repository where a standard model card template and file structure is being developed

The idea is, any project working with a machine learning model(s) can use this template and include it in their own repository. This mean whenever a model is updated, the mdoel card can be updated alongside.

The repo includes:
1. The model card template
2. An images folder where visualisations such as a confusion matrix can be stored for use in a model card
