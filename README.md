# NHS England Template Model Card


## Purpose
The main purpose of a model card is to *standardise ethical practice and reporting*[^1] and is primarily geared towards aiding transparency around a model's use of data and methods and its resulting performance. Model cards are intended to be *short* documents that contain non-technical and technical content for a variety of audiences.

Model cards should be succinct, well-structured and easily digestible by the reader. A model card is *not a replacement for detailed documentation* covering quality assurance, testing, bias analysis and so on. High-level overview of these areas can be included on a model card where relevant, but any further detail should be accessible from the model card via links to full documentation.

By having a standardised template, creators of models can produce clear and open documentation, allowing for valuable scrutiny of solutions both internally and publicly.

This template can be copied into a new or existing repository and populated with information about the models that have been trained or that are in use in a system/service/algorithm. Storing the model card in a repository along with the code used to train, test and evaluate models will help to keep documentation up to date as both the model and it's documentation can be updated in parallel. It also enables easy publication of the model card into a public repository.


## Origins

Model cards were introduced in a [2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993) and have been adapted by a number of organisations.

The initial design and set-up of the model card template drew inspiration from:
* [Google](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/object-detection) 
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/var0101/model-cards)
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards)

[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards) also uses model cards, but examples of these are more focussed around the reusability of a model â€“ where someone develops an open source model that can be fine tuned or embedded within an algorithmic tool/process - rather than models that are trained and then deployed into a live system.
